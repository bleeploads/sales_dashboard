# Sales Dashboard for Sports & Outdoor Goods Retailer

This project is namely used to display competency in using Power BI. Sales data is obtained from a fictional sports & outdoor goods retailer. The data available is from January 2019 - January 2021. 

SQL Server was used for data processing before importing to Power BI to create the sales dashboard. The dashboard is split across 3 pages (Sales Overview, Customer Details, Product Details).
